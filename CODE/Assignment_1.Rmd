## R Markdown
This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
#Loading the csv file
Georgia = read.csv("C:/Users/shara/OneDrive/Desktop/JCU/Sem_3/MB5370/Data_Science_inR/Assignment_1/DATA/imp - Sheet1.csv")
Georgia$Date <- factor(Georgia$Date, levels = unique(Georgia$Date))
#Tidying the data
Georgia <- Georgia %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -Date, names_to = "County", values_to = "Value")

#Plotting the groped bar chart
Plot = ggplot(Georgia, aes(x = Date, y = Value)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))+
facet_wrap(~ County, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
print(Plot)
```
